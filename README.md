# ColorDetector-Python

Color Detector Under Mouse Alpha

This Script supposed to get color under mouse and then display it as a tooltip in real time.

But I still don't know how to do that..

You get the color by pressing '+' key on keyboard. Then window is going to show up what color is it. Press ESC to exit app

Bugs:
    Does not work on multiple monitors
